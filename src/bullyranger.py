this module should contain functions and shit that implement the anti bullying ideas I had
tl;dr of the ideas
open dms on the bot
dm the username of a cyberbully
every time the cyberbully posts an abusive tweet reply to them "Hey stop that!"
use bark api to determine if the tweets are abusive
if a tracked cyberbully stops being abusive then they will stop being tracked and the person(s) who originally reported them will be notified
'''

#todo(aaorn) code this
#so we have to probably have a database for storing all the data about the people's hatefulness
'''
keep info about their average hate level
some messages....
You're always so hateful, can you tone it down?
That's not nice!
Hey, stop that!
Don't bully!
etc
also it compares their current hate level to their average level. if they are at the highest level displays more intense messages

WHEW!
Looks like I'm going to actually need some practical dba knowledge of dba...
Figure out how to structure the databse and then build the program on that.
